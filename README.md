# Kings Footsie

Fun fact: Twister was [originally named Kings Footsie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twister_(game)).

This tiny React app automatically chooses one of four appendages (left foot, right foot, left hand, right hand), plus one of four colors (red, green, yellow, blue), every six seconds. The background color and text will change to reflect the new move and color, and the [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis](SpeechSynthesis) API will call out the play.

Click start to start. Click stop to stop.

That's it.

## Technical Details

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and put together in the time it took someone else to tape a homemade 6x4 color grid to the floor.
